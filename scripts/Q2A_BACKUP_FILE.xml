I&#039;d suggest rewriting this to follow my template and see if that clarifies what goes wrong.

&nbsp;

CLAIM: In any set of [latex]h[/latex] horses, all horses are the same color.

&nbsp;

<em>FaultyProof</em> by Induction on [latex]h[/latex].

&nbsp;

Base: For [latex]h = 1[/latex]. In any set containing just one horse, all horses clearly are the same color.

&nbsp;

Induction Step: For [latex]kge 1[/latex] assume that the claim is true for [latex]h = k[/latex] and prove that it is true for [latex]h = k+1[/latex].

&nbsp;

Take any set [latex]H[/latex] of [latex]k+1[/latex] horses. We show that all the horses in this set are the same color. Remove one horse from this set to obtain the set [latex]H _ 1[/latex] with just [latex]k[/latex] horses. By the induction hypothesis, all the horses in [latex]H _ 1[/latex] are the same color. Now replace the removed horse and remove a different one to obtain the set [latex]H _ 2[/latex]. By the same argument, all the horses in [latex]H _ 2[/latex] are the same color. Therefore, all the horses in [latex]H[/latex] must be the same color, and the proof is complete.]]></content></question><question><title>What advice on writing proofs do you find useful?</title><content><![CDATA[The book chapter on proofs

<span style="font-size: medium">Blue Eyes:</span>
<span style="font-size: xx-small">The Hardest Logic Puzzle in the World</span>A group of people with assorted eye colors live on an island. They are all perfect logicians -- if a conclusion can be logically deduced, they will do it instantly. No one knows the color of their eyes. Every night at midnight, a ferry stops at the island. Any islanders who have figured out the color of their own eyes then leave the island, and the rest stay. Everyone can see everyone else at all times and keeps a count of the number of people they see with each eye color (excluding themselves), but they cannot otherwise communicate. Everyone on the island knows all the rules in this paragraph.

On this island there are 100 blue-eyed people, 100 brown-eyed people, and the Guru (she happens to have green eyes). So any given blue-eyed person can see 100 people with brown eyes and 99 people with blue eyes (and one with green), but that does not tell him his own eye color; as far as he knows the totals could be 101 brown and 99 blue. Or 100 brown, 99 blue, and he could have red eyes.

The Guru is allowed to speak once (let&#039;s say at noon), on one day in all their endless years on the island. Standing before the islanders, she says the following:

<strong>"I can see someone who has blue eyes."</strong>

Who leaves the island, and on what night?

There are no mirrors or reflecting surfaces, nothing dumb. It is not a trick question, and the answer is logical. It doesn&#039;t depend on tricky wording or anyone lying or guessing, and it doesn&#039;t involve people doing something silly like creating a sign language or doing genetics. The Guru is not making eye contact with anyone in particular; she&#039;s simply saying "I count at least one blue-eyed person on this island who isn&#039;t me."

And lastly, the answer is not "no one leaves."

----------------

<span style="font-size: xx-small">Terry Tao discusses a much more vicious version: </span>

<span style="font-size: xx-small">There is an island upon which a tribe resides. The tribe consists of 1000 people, with various eye colours. Yet, their religion forbids them to know their own eye color, or even to discuss the topic; thus, each resident can (and does) see the eye colors of all other residents, but has no way of discovering his or her own (there are no reflective surfaces). If a tribesperson does discover his or her own eye color, then their religion compels them to commit ritual suicide at noon the following day in the village square for all to witness. All the tribespeople are highly logical and devout, and they all know that each other is also highly logical and devout (and they all know that they all know that each other is highly logical and devout, and so forth).  ["Highly logical" means that any conclusion that can logically deduced from the information and observations available to an islander, will automatically be known to that islander.]</span>

<span style="font-size: xx-small">Of the 1000 islanders, it turns out that 100 of them have blue eyes and 900 of them have brown eyes, although the islanders are not initially aware of these statistics (each of them can of course only see 999 of the 1000 tribespeople).</span>

<span style="font-size: xx-small">One day, a blue-eyed foreigner visits to the island and wins the complete trust of the tribe.</span>

<span style="font-size: xx-small">One evening, he addresses the entire tribe to thank them for their hospitality.</span>

<span style="font-size: xx-small">However, not knowing the customs, the foreigner makes the mistake of mentioning eye color in his address, remarking “how unusual it is to see another blue-eyed person like myself in this region of the world”.</span>

<span style="font-size: xx-small">What effect, if anything, does this <em>faux pas</em> have on the tribe?</span>]]></content></question><question><title>world</title><content><![CDATA[On Raymond Island, "knights" always tell the truth, "knaves" always lie, and "normals" sometimes tell the truth and sometimes lie.

CLAIM: In any set of [latex]h[/latex] horses, all horses are the same color.

&nbsp;

<em>FaultyProof</em> by Induction on [latex]h[/latex].

&nbsp;

Base: For [latex]h = 1[/latex]. In any set containing just one horse, all horses clearly are the same color.

&nbsp;

Induction Step: For [latex]kge 1[/latex] assume that the claim is true for [latex]h = k[/latex] and prove that it is true for [latex]h = k+1[/latex].

&nbsp;

Take any set [latex]H[/latex] of [latex]k+1[/latex] horses. We show that all the horses in this set are the same color. Remove one horse from this set to obtain the set [latex]H _ 1[/latex] with just [latex]k[/latex] horses. By the induction hypothesis, all the horses in [latex]H _ 1[/latex] are the same color. Now replace the removed horse and remove a different one to obtain the set [latex]H _ 2[/latex]. By the same argument, all the horses in [latex]H _ 2[/latex] are the same color.

You are an outsider, sent by a news agency, to identify if there is a celebrity at a party of n people.  You want to ask people if they know specific other people, but don&#039;t want to annoy and get kicked out, so you want to ask few questions.   There are, of course, (<em>n</em>-1) possible questions per person, for a total of <em>n</em>(<em>n</em>-1).  How few questions do you need to ask to guarantee that you can always identify and confirm the identity of a celebrity, if one exists?  (You cannot ask one person "Do you know anyone here?&#039; without asking them n-1 questions, which is sure to get you kicked out.)

I suggest working the room in two phases: first, start by assuming
that anyone could be a celebrity, and ask questions that try to rule
people out.  Then, when you have single candidate, ask questions to
confirm. 

You should be able to use induction to obtain a strategy in which each person, with one possible exception, need be asked at most two questions.

&nbsp;

I&#039;m thinking of a natural number [latex]x[/latex] between 1 and [latex]n[/latex]. You can ask questions of the form, ``Is [latex]x[/latex] larger than [latex]a[/latex]?&#039;&#039; and I will tell you (truthfully) yes or no. Show that, in the worst case, [latex]lceillog_2 nceil[/latex] questions are necessary and sufficient to exactly determine my number.

&nbsp;

For sufficiency, you may want to argue that you can round [latex]n[/latex] up to the next power of 2 to make your proof easier: e.g., new [latex]n=2^{lceillog_2 nceil}[/latex].

&nbsp;

To show that this many are necessary is harder, you have to imagine that you are the one picking the number, but you keep your options open until the guesser starts asking questions.]]></content></question><question><title>world</title><content><![CDATA[Suppose there are [latex]n[/latex] identical cars stopped on a circular track, and

that the total gas in all tanks is enough for one car to make it

around the track (even if it had to stop and start [latex]n[/latex] times.) Show

that there is at least one car that can make it around if it siphons

all the gas from each of the stopped cars it passes.

I suggest trying to prove the statement "For any n cars on a racetrack, if the total gas in all cars is enough to complete a circuit of the track, then there exists a car that can complete the circuit by siphoning gas from cars it passes."  By mentioning the gas in the statement, you are more likely to have a correct proof.]]></content></question><question><title>world</title><content><![CDATA[Nim is a simple two players game with two stacks of chips, matches, or other counters.

Suppose for some <em>n</em>≥2 that <em>n</em> children are given a large vat of holiday cookie dough to divide amongst themselves.

You meet 5 natives, A, B, C,&hellip; who made the following statements:
 <p style="padding-left: 30px">
Native A said: ˝In the set {E} there is an odd  number of knights.˝
Native B said: ˝In the set {ADE} there is an even  number of knights.˝
Native C said: ˝In the set {} there is an odd  number of knights.˝
Native D said: ˝In the set {E} there is an even  number of knights.˝
Native E said: ˝In the set {C} there is an even  number of knights.˝
</p>
Who are the knights and who are the knaves?

Lets write [latex]aKb[/latex] iff <em>a</em> knows <em>b</em>, and [latex]a

ot!!Ka)[/latex].  Can a group have more than one celebrity?

You are an outsider, sent by a news agency, to identify if there is a celebrity at a party of n people.  You want to ask people if they know specific other people, but don&#039;t want to annoy and get kicked out, so you want to ask few questions.   There are, of course, (<em>n</em>-1) possible questions per person, for a total of <em>n</em>(<em>n</em>-1).  How few questions do you need to ask to guarantee that you can always identify and confirm the identity of a celebrity, if one exists?  (You cannot ask one person "Do you know anyone here?&#039; without asking them n-1 questions, which is sure to get you kicked out.)

I suggest working the room in two phases: first, start by assuming
that anyone could be a celebrity, and ask questions that try to rule
people out.  Then, when you have single candidate, ask questions to

(more challenging)</title><content><![CDATA[This was the problem I alluded to in Induction25:

Suppose for some <em>n</em>≥2 that <em>n</em> children are given a large vat of holiday cookie dough to divide amongst themselves. The children do not trust one another; each is convinced that the other <em>n-1 </em>are out to steal more than their fair share. Prove by induction on <em>n </em>that under the following division procedure, each child will leave the bargaining table convinced that he or she has not been shortchanged on cookie dough.

&nbsp;

First, one child selects what he or she believes to be exactly an <em>n</em>th of the cookie dough. The remaining children are then given the opportunity, one at a time, to inspect this portion. If a child perceives it to be no more than an <em>n</em>th of the entire batch, it passes to the next child for inspection. Otherwise, this child shaves off whatever he or she deems to be the excessive amount, returns the extra dough to the vat, and claims the remainder as his or her portion. This portion is then inspected by the next child. The inspection process continues, with the portion changing hands and being reduced whenever it is perceived to be unfairly large, until all children have had the opportunity to examine it. At this time, whoever is in possession of the dough portion devours it and leaves the room. The <em>n-1 </em>children who are left then repeat the procedure: One child selects what he or she believes to be an (<em>n-1</em>)st of what is left in the vat and another round of inspections begins, at the end of which one child devours a hunk of dough and departs. The process continues until all but one child have left the room, at which point the remaining child consumes what is left in the vat.]]></content></question><question><title>Induction 36: What happens to the islanders?</title><content><![CDATA[From <a href="http://xkcd.com/blue_eyes.html">http://xkcd.com/blue_eyes.html</a>

<span style="font-size: medium">Blue Eyes:</span>
<span style="font-size: xx-small">The Hardest Logic Puzzle in the World</span>A group of people with assorted eye colors live on an island. They are all perfect logicians -- if a conclusion can be logically deduced, they will do it instantly. No one knows the color of their eyes. Every night at midnight, a ferry stops at the island. Any islanders who have figured out the color of their own eyes then leave the island, and the rest stay. Everyone can see everyone else at all times and keeps a count of the number of people they see with each eye color (excluding themselves), but they cannot otherwise communicate. Everyone on the island knows all the rules in this paragraph.

On this island there are 100 blue-eyed people, 100 brown-eyed people, and the Guru (she happens to have green eyes). So any given blue-eyed person can see 100 people with brown eyes and 99 people with blue eyes (and one with green), but that does not tell him his own eye color; as far as he knows the totals could be 101 brown and 99 blue. Or 100 brown, 99 blue, and he could have red eyes.

The Guru is allowed to speak once (let&#039;s say at noon), on one day in all their endless years on the island. Standing before the islanders, she says the following:

<strong>"I can see someone who has blue eyes."</strong>

Who leaves the island, and on what night?

There are no mirrors or reflecting surfaces, nothing dumb. It is not a trick question, and the answer is logical. It doesn&#039;t depend on tricky wording or anyone lying or guessing, and it doesn&#039;t involve people doing something silly like creating a sign language or doing genetics. The Guru is not making eye contact with anyone in particular; she&#039;s simply saying "I count at least one blue-eyed person on this island who isn&#039;t me."

And lastly, the answer is not "no one leaves."

----------------

<span style="font-size: xx-small">Terry Tao discusses a much more vicious version: </span>

<span style="font-size: xx-small">There is an island upon which a tribe resides. The tribe consists of 1000 people, with various eye colours. Yet, their religion forbids them to know their own eye color, or even to discuss the topic; thus, each resident can (and does) see the eye colors of all other residents, but has no way of discovering his or her own (there are no reflective surfaces). If a tribesperson does discover his or her own eye color, then their religion compels them to commit ritual suicide at noon the following day in the village square for all to witness. All the tribespeople are highly logical and devout, and they all know that each other is also highly logical and devout (and they all know that they all know that each other is highly logical and devout, and so forth).  ["Highly logical" means that any conclusion that can logically deduced from the information and observations available to an islander, will automatically be known to that islander.]</span>

<span style="font-size: xx-small">Of the 1000 islanders, it turns out that 100 of them have blue eyes and 900 of them have brown eyes, although the islanders are not initially aware of these statistics (each of them can of course only see 999 of the 1000 tribespeople).</span>

<span style="font-size: xx-small">One day, a blue-eyed foreigner visits to the island and wins the complete trust of the tribe.</span>

<span style="font-size: xx-small">One evening, he addresses the entire tribe to thank them for their hospitality.</span>

<span style="font-size: xx-small">However, not knowing the customs, the foreigner makes the mistake of mentioning eye color in his address, remarking “how unusual it is to see another blue-eyed person like myself in this region of the world”.</span>

<span style="font-size: xx-small">What effect, if anything, does this <em>faux pas</em> have on the tribe?</span>]]></content></question><question><title>Induction 41: What is this recursively defined function?</title><content><![CDATA[Here is the recursive definition of a function [latex]fcolonmathbb{N}	omathbb{R}[/latex]:

In the problem there are 5 inhabitants: A,B,C,D &amp; E. The first 4 of them make a statement.
<p style="padding-left: 30px">A: E is a knave if and only if C is a knight.
B: If D is a knave, then A is a knight.
C: A is a knave if and only if B is a knight.
D: If A is a knave, then E is a knave.</p>
Write down what you learn from each statement in logical notation. Use <em>A</em> as a True or False variable to mean that inhabitant A is a knight.  Thus, if A says statement P, we would know <em>A iff P</em>, or  <em>A↔(P)</em>   (You may want to bookmark this <a title="page of math symbols" href="https://comp283f13.web.unc.edu/146-2/" target="_blank">page of math symbols</a> to copy symbols from.)

Determine who is a knight  and who is a knave so that what we learn from each statement is true.]]></content></question><question><title>Determine the tribes of Nomanisan10?</title><content><![CDATA[On Nomanisan Island, the natives communicate only person to person.
